# EE551-Python
This code analyzes finacial data from yahoo finance. importRequests.py was an attempt to manually fetch the csv file for a specific ticker using the requests moudle, however there was an issue that the resulting csv would only show error messages. 
Upon further research i found the amazing use of pandas and pandas data reader packages. These were used to grab the historical data for a specified stock and date range from yahoo. I then use this to calculate many valuable data in stocks.py.
timeToUnix.py  was originally supposed to calculate the unix time of the date ranged you wanted for the data(the unix time is used the url for the csv) but I then changed it to grab input from the user and return the date in the form used by pandas_dataeader.datareader. stocksDatabase.py is an attemlt to use the database sqlite3 as a form of manipulation of the data and further the complexity  and usefulness of it. However, it is unfinished.
